BigReactors
===========

Updated?
-------------

This is the fixed and hardcored version of BigReactors mod for 
Minecraft 1.7.10
Forge 1.7.10 10.13.4.1614

Because u cant just download and work on default BigReactors projects so this one is for making that process easier.
Also i added some hardcore crafts and blocks in this mode, just because i like that way more.

I will update and publish this for newer version of Minecraft soon.


Alpha
--------

Big Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no _known_ serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.

You can download the latest alpha from [the big-reactors.com download page](http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download).

_You will need other mods_ to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend [Thermal Expansion](http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion).
