BigReactors
===========

What is this?
-------------

An upcoming mod for Minecraft, based on adding new and fun ways to generate power through big multi-block structures. Don't just plop blocks, design the machines yourself!

For near-future plans and development status, see the Roadmap file.

Big Reactors has an official website at [www.big-reactors.com](http://www.big-reactors.com)

Alpha
--------

Big Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no _known_ serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.

You can download the latest alpha from [the big-reactors.com download page](http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download).

_You will need other mods_ to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend [Thermal Expansion](http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion).
